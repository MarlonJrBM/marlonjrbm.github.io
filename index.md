Brazilian living in France, I'm a software developer in the EDA industry. I have experience with low-level and high-level systems, having worked with a variety of programming languages, such as C++, Python, Ruby on Rails and ASP.NET. I'm interested in topics such as open-source, software engineering, computer security and personal/professional development. My skill set include, among others:

- C++ Development
- Experience with various EDA Tools (such as ZeBu, Verdi and VCS)
- Revision Control (Git and Perforce)
- Build Automation (CI)
- Software Refactoring
- Architectural and Design Patterns
- Software Testing (automated unit and integration testing, TDD)
- Algorithm design and analysis
- Development experience in UNIX-like systems and their associated scripting languages
- Understanding of Software Development Life Cycle (SLDC)
- Knowledge of Software Development Methodologies (Agile, Scrum, etc)
- Experience with Compiler and Language Development
- Experience with ML (Machine Learning) algorithms

Other than computers, some of the things I really enjoy are cycling, crossfit, mindfulness and beers. I also believe in my duty to try and make the community around me a better place through voluntary work, so I'm a proud member of [Rotaract](https://www.rotary.org/en/get-involved/rotaract-clubs).
