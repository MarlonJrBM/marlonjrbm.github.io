{% include icon-coffee.html %}

Brazilian living in France, I'm a software developer in the EDA industry. I have experience with low-level and high-level systems, having worked with a variety of programming languages, such as C++, Python, Ruby on Rails and ASP.NET. I'm interested in topics such as C++ programming, open-source, software engineering, computer security and personal/professional development.

If you would like to know more about my professional experience, I invite you to take a look at my {% include icon-linkedin.html label='Linkedin' username="marlonjrbm" %}.

Other than computers, some of the things I really enjoy are cycling, crossfit, mindfulness, beers and coffee. I also believe in my duty to try and make the community around me a better place through voluntary work, so I'm a proud member of [Rotaract](https://www.rotary.org/en/get-involved/rotaract-clubs).

If you would like to connect, the pleasure would be all mine! Interact with me on {% include icon-twitter.html label='Twitter' username="marlonjrbm" label='Twitter' %} or {% include icon-github.html username="marlonjrbm" label='GitHub' %}.
