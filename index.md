introduction: |
  Brazilian living in France, I'm a software developer in the EDA industry. I have experience with low-level and high-level systems, having worked with a variety of programming languages, such as C++, Python, Ruby on Rails and ASP.NET. I'm interested in topics such as software engineering, computer security and personal/professional development.

My current professional focus is on the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) industry. My skill set include, among others:
- C++ Development
- Revision Control (Git and Perforce)
- Build Automation
- Software Refactoring
- Architectural and Design Patterns
- Software Testing (automated unit and integration testing)
- Algorithm design and analysis (computational complexity, etc)
- Development experience in UNIX-like systems and their associated scripting languages
- Understanding of Software Development Life Cycle (SLDC)
- Knowledge of Software Development Methodologies (Agile, Scrum, etc)
- Experience with Compiler Development
- Experience with EDA Hardware Emulation Tools
- Experience with ML (Machine Learning) algorithms

  Being the "social creature" that I am, this site/blog is an attempt of mine of becoming a "social developer", let's see how it goes!
