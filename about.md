<p>Brazilian living in France, I'm a software developer in the EDA industry. Academically, I hold a BSc in Computer Science from <a href="https://ufmg.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UFMG</a>. Professionally, I have experience with low-level and high-level systems, having worked with a variety of programming languages, such as C++, Python, Ruby on Rails and ASP.NET. I'm interested in topics such as C++ programming, open-source, software engineering, computer security and personal development.</p>

<p>If you would like to know more about my professional experience, I invite you to take a look at my {% include icon-linkedin.html label='LinkedIn' username="marlonjrbm" %} and {% include icon-github.html username="marlonjrbm" label='GitHub' %}.</p>

<p>Other than computers, some things I really enjoy are exercising (especially cycling), listening to music (especially rock), and having a good meal (especially if it comes with a good beer) while discussing the meaning of life. I also believe in my duty to try and make the community around me a better place through voluntary work, so I'm a proud member of <a href="https://www.rotary.org/en/get-involved/rotaract-clubs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotaract</a>.</p>

<p>Getting started in programming can be a daunting task, but it's not impossible. If I did it, so can you. If you are a beginner and need some help, or if you just want to connect, feel free to reach me on {% include icon-linkedin.html label='LinkedIn' username="marlonjrbm" %} or {% include icon-twitter.html username="marlonjrbm" label='Twitter' %}. Please note that, besides English, I also speak Portuguese and French, should you feel more comfortable in these languages.</p>
