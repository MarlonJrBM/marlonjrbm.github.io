<p>Brazilian living in France, I'm a software developer in the EDA industry. I have experience with low-level and high-level systems, having worked with a variety of programming languages, such as C++, Python, Ruby on Rails and ASP.NET. I'm interested in topics such as C++ programming, open-source, software engineering, computer security and personal development.</p>

<p>If you would like to know more about my professional experience, I invite you to take a look at my {% include icon-linkedin.html label='Linkedin' username="marlonjrbm" %}.</p>

<p>Other than computers, some of the things I really enjoy are exercising (especially cycling), listening to music (especially rock), and having a good meal (especially if it comes with a good beer) while discussing the meaning of life. I also believe in my duty to try and make the community around me a better place through voluntary work, so I'm a proud member of <a href="https://www.rotary.org/en/get-involved/rotaract-clubs">Rotaract</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to connect, the pleasure would be all mine! Feel free to interact with me on {% include icon-twitter.html username="marlonjrbm" label='Twitter' %} or {% include icon-github.html username="marlonjrbm" label='GitHub' %}. Furthermore, if you live in the Paris region and you want to discuss the hottest C++ feature of the moment, let's meet up for a coffee!</p>
