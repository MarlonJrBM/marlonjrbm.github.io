The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, by Stephen R. Covey. This has got to be one of my favorite books ever. It has a very clickbait title, I’ll be the first to admit it, still, but do not let that demotivate you. This book does contain many invaluable teachings that will never age.

These are simple, maybe even obvious teachings, but I have a feeling we neglect it quite often. How come this is not taught in school ?

I will list the habits shortly, but first I will mention something I find fascinating about them. They have a chronological order, and that was a thoughtful choice of the author. The first three habits, for instance, focus on the self (he calls them private victory), and the other 4 focus on interactions with other people (public victory). This has a very good reason: it is not possible to focus on one’s interaction with other people if one doesn’t take care of oneself first.

The habits are:

- Habit 1: Be Proactive
- Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind
- Habit 3: Put first things first
- Habit 4: Think win-win
- Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood
- Habit 6: Synergize
- Habit 7: Sharpen the saw

There are quite a few concepts and tools the author introduces to better visualize all these habits. For this post I will focus on one: principles.

It is not easy to develop all these habits, so the author uses the following argument to motivate his readers: principles. He will explain that living by principles is the only way to find the discipline and motivation to follow these habits. In my view, principles are the values and morals one defines for oneself to live a fulfilling life. Naturally, it is to each person to find their own principles, and that itself is no easy task. But once they are found, you should stick to them, and use them as the center of your life.

Yes, because we usually steer our lives around one or more centers. According to the author, there are many things which can be the center of people’s lives: money, work, family, church, the self. He argues that even though all these things are important, they should not be the center of one’s life. Principles should be, as by definition they provide us with the stability to find fulfillment in all areas, and make decisions in accordance with one’s true desires.

I personally believe it is quite difficult to find principles to live by for your whole life, especially in this liquid modernity that we live in, except if they are quite vague. Still, even if you are not sure of your principles, you will find great knowledge in this book. I understand this short reflection might not be enough to persuade someone to read the book, but you should nevertheless give it a chance. I cannot recommend this book enough !
